# Fedora's Market
###### Built for `Sponge 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT`, and off of `JDK 1.8.0_71`.

A Market plugin, currently in dev, that [will include] chest shops, p2p trading, auctioning, and other things.

**THIS DOES REQUIRE AN ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION**; I use [EconomyLite](https://github.com/Flibio/EconomyLite).

Enjoy!
